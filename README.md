### IMPORTANTE LER ! ↓
Esse app foi criado no intuito de estudar mais para aprofundamento da tecnologia 'React JS', criei o mesmo com ajuda de um professor, mas quero deixar guardado meus estudos para um futuro avanço na área de DEV front-end. Estou em *aprendizagem*, e esse app não está 100% pronto, está sujeito a atualizações.

### IMPORTANT TO READ ! ↓
This app was created with the intention of studying more to deepen the 'React JS' technology, I created it with the help of a professor, but I want to save my studies for a future advance in the front-end DEV area. I'm in *learning*, and this app is not 100% ready, it is subject to updates.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i`
### `npm update`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Open a new console inside the project directory:
### `npm run backend`

It will run the API created for the app to work [http://localhost:5000].

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
